7.5 billion dollars.<br /><br />
 
That's the price at which Microsoft bought GitHub this past month. Why? Sure, GitHub is a platform accessed daily by thousands of coders, but what made it valuable enough for Microsoft to value it at 7.5 billion dollars? Was it to promote the use of Microsoft's IDE, Visual Studio Code? Nope, as CEO Satya Nadella has assured us that there will be no major changes to GitHub's infrastructure. Though no clear statement was made on GitHub's use to Microsoft, it is clear that Microsoft is shifting its company ideologies in a new direction, emphasising the importance of collaboration and open source. Instead, with GitHub's 27 million+ software developers working on over 85 million repositories of code, it is quite apparent that Microsoft is focusing on serving software developers (whether those developers are coding for Windows or not).<br /><br />
 
GitHub assures its users that this acquisition would have no impact on the platform they've come to love. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath said that, "Their focus on developers lines up perfectly with our own, and their scale, tools and global cloud will play a huge role in making GitHub even more valuable for developers everywhere." With Nat Friedman taking over GitHub as CEO and Wanstrath gearing up to join Microsoft's board, Wanstrath's faith in Microsoft is largely based on their ability to maintain a high level of autonomy and on the moves made by Microsoft's current CEO over the past few years. In fact, let's talk a little bit about the level-headed and forward-thinking vanguard of Microsoft: Satya Nadella.<br /><br />
 
This deal shows the enormous changes that the current CEO has put in place since he took charge. Only a couple of years ago, Microsoft was taking yearly losses as it struggled to compete with the giants of Google and Apple. By ditching the Windows Phone, Microsoft has been able to focus on improving different aspects of its business model. With its emphasis on computing, Microsoft has taken leaps which show in their increased profits and (finally) some significant positive quarterly earnings. Nadella’s move to acquire LinkedIn in 2016 was no rushed decision either. A 26 billion dollar acquisition, Satya Nadella was turning the company around from Steve Ballmer's costly mistake with Nokia, where Microsoft tried to capture the mobile market by pushing the Windows Phone. Nadella is committed to shaping the image of Microsoft from one of a closed community to one of open inclusion. His accomplishment with shifting Microsoft's public image cannot be understated and, with his latest move, it seems that Nadella is making all of the right moves, opening his arms to open source software.<br /><br />

But how will Nadella integrate Microsoft’s environment with GitHub? GitHub hosts over 27 million developers who depend on using GitHub’s services daily. Since these developers serve as the key market for Microsoft’s developer tools, Microsoft will be able to push its technologies to a larger market. Their goal is to be able to empower developers at <em>“every step of the development lifecycle.”</em> Their biggest plans come with the GitHub marketplace where Microsoft intends to utilize the marketplace in order to push all of Microsoft’s tools and services to make it available to everyone in the developer community. Finally, Microsoft is dedicated to seamlessly integrating Visual Studio Code’s  environment directly into GitHub so developers can collaborate with less effort and boost overall productivity.<br /><br />
 
A last bit of interesting news comes from Diane Greene, head of Google's cloud, who mentioned, <em>"I wouldn’t have minded buying them."</em> Google has two of GitHub's largest projects, TensorFlow and Kubernetes, and are GitHub's biggest contributor. Greene suggested that Microsoft's bid may have been too high to prompt Google to throw its hat into the ring. She leaves off with the hope the Microsoft will keep GitHub neutral because GitHub was founded on the basis of open source.<br /><br />
 
Finally, Satya Nadella's explains the merger:<br /><br />
 
 <em>“Computing is becoming embedded in the world, with every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy being transformed by digital technology. Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the world’s code. And GitHub is their home.”</em><br /><br />
 
Albeit polished, his words continue to reflect Microsoft's bright future.<br /><br />
 
The deal will close later this year, with the payment being completed in stocks.<br /><br /><br />

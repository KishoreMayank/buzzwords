Hypermedia, and instant gratification- two concepts that have defined the current generation over the course of the last decade. With every passing second, data and information is becoming more readily available, and mass media becomes more normal. With this comes the rising desire for those who use modern technology to peruse this sea of information at this breakneck speed- and it seems that these speeds can never be fast enough for the millenials of this world today, as products like the new MacBook are catering to these new desires. The question, however, is whether or not these features will be a viable and worthy improvement for all consumers.<br /><br />

Apple has made a bold step forward in the goal to put the “instant” in “instant gratification.” In a July 12, 2018 press release, the company made an announcement that the new MacBook line will feature more dynamic processing power than any MacBook before has ever seen- the new 15 inch model boasts a 6 core intel core processor which will increase processing speed by up to 70% according to Apple. This seems like a perfect way for Apple to make already seemingly instant processes even more instant. Many people will see this overwhelming processing capacity and cave in to the high price point, while not even thinking twice before stopping to ask the simple, yet thought provoking questions- what is a processor? What makes a computer processor fast? Is more processing power even speeding up my computer based on the activities I am using it for?<br /><br />

One of the most essential components of a computer is the Central Processing Unit, more commonly referred to as the CPU. Think of this as a movie director who is directing the cast and crew behind the scenes to make sure that the final product is as desired. The CPU is the powerhouse of the computer that takes in data and outputs valuable information (valuable is a relative term). This process of converting data can be stored programmatically so that the CPU will know how to digest the data that it is analyzing. The CPU contains a control unit, and an arithmetic/logic unit (ALU). The control unit essentially delegates tasks for the ALU and other components of the computer to execute, while also being able to interact with the memory of the computer.<br /><br /> 

Upon understanding CPUs at this high level, a few more key concepts must be understood before delving into what makes some processors fast and others slow. When the CPU has to execute a set of instructions, there must be an information decoder and fetcher to essentially break the commands into data that the control unit can decipher and delegate to other components, most notably the ALU. With the power of modern computing, many CPUs are now capable of conducting branch prediction- a way for the computer to analyze what the fastest way to execute a program would be- to, in turn, minimize the amount of time taken for the program to execute (and make users happy). Many processors are also capable of multitasking now, which means that if a program is not completed, its current position can be stored and resumed later when the computer can try once more to see if the necessary components to run the program are in place. <br /><br />

With the mind boggling capability of the CPU, it begs the question- if these things are so fast and so versatile with how they handle information, what gives?<br /><br />

<strong>What makes a computer fast?</strong><br />
Based on what we have already talked about, the most logical way to make a fast processor is to make sure it processes data quickly. The speed at which data is processed is partially controlled by an <em>internal clock</em>. Each time this internal clock ticks, one can think of the processor as processing 1 command. Therefore, clock frequency plays an integral role in how fast a computer can process decoded data. A faster clock speed will make your computer faster, in most cases regardless of what you are doing. <br /><br />

<strong>Memory</strong>- you have probably seen an error message at some point in your life in which your computing device so kindly reminds you that you are running out of memory. Although frustrating, this will undoubtedly slow down the processing speed of your computer, most notably when you are running out of storage. This “storage” that we are always running out of, is primary storage, where data that needs to be quickly accessed can be called upon. When we are close to running out of memory, our computers will move data that is not being used to “secondary storage”, in which the computer still has access, but at a much slower rate. Although moving data to secondary storage is temporary (until it is needed again and there is enough room to store the information once more in primary memory), this slows down the speed of one’s computer and may induce lag. This is why increasing memory capacity does have legitimate effects for your computer speed, especially when you are running more than one program or trying to multitask on your device.<br /><br />

One final concept that contributes to computer processing speed is a “<em>bus.</em>” A bus is a connection between multiple computer devices that allows for the flow of data. Per bus, there are a certain number (variable) of wires that can each carry 1 bit of data- the more wires the bus contains, the more data it can address. A slower bus means slower access to data, and therefore slower completion of a specific process. Additionally, there will likely be lower processing speed as the CPU, along with other computer components, will not have access to data addresses as quickly as they can take them. <br /><br />

<strong>So is the new computer worth my money?</strong><br />
I’ll repeat it, 6 core intel core processor. Just for clarification, each one of these cores can be seen as an individual CPU. Basic logic would tell us that this is fantastic: more cores = more CPUs = more processing speed, because why wouldn’t more cores be equated to more speed? Well, some programs cannot use multiple cores efficiently to complete the tasks. <br /><br />

Another questionable feature that is yet to be uncovered about the new MacBook is its battery life. It is impossible for computers to supply power to only one core at a time, even if not all cores are in use. This means that in general, battery life will be reduced by the increased number of cores in the computer, and also increased heat of the computer. Although Apple may have made changes to thwart issues like these, be wary of them when considering computers with high processing power. <br /><br />

Tasks are split sequentially, not necessarily logically. Even in multi threaded programs (where programs can utilize more than one processor), processors can all take on tasks, but bigger tasks cannot be split up amongst processors, in which case having extra processors may not be beneficial at all. <br /><br />

The reality is, processing power is highly dependent on what the user wants, different applications will use the cores more (or less) efficiently than others. In areas that support multi threading, more cores will significantly impact the speed of the program, provided that other checks are in order (sufficient memory, for example). Video game players, video editors, and programmers, for example, will reap the benefits of the 6 core processors of the 2018 MacBook device. Single threaded actions such as casual web browsing and other Office tools such as writing school essays, will not see the same upside in an upgrade, however. Despite the intuition and the flash behind increased number of cores, there are so many factors to attribute to computer speed other than simply the computer processor itself. <br /><br />

Apple has come out with a product that is aimed to put itself in the conversation with other computers that have  extremely high processing powers, and hopes to extend its scope from a pretty laptop with cute gadgetry to a powerful workhorse that can take on a heavy load. While this is certainly a valid and interesting move by Apple, their casual mention of general increased speeds should raise skepticism amongst the casual computer user and possibly prompt them to look elsewhere for their next computer. It may end up being easier on their wallet too, and their constant search for faster access to data will continue. <br /><br /><br />

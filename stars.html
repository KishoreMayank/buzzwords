No. Not Hollywood stars.<br /><br />

I mean those huge balls of gas outputting the energy of 100 billion atomic bombs every second. Pretty cool right?<br />
So how does it all begin?<br /><br />

Nebulae, which are towering clouds of dust and gas that can have diameters hundreds of lightyears long, can lay dormant for millions and billions of years. All it takes is the slightest increase in pressure or density to cause a chain reaction. Eventually, these stars take in enough matter to form stellar "seeds" or protostar. Once a protostar is formed, it begins to spin faster and faster as it continues to consume all of the nearby matter (mostly still dust and gas particles). The material begins to flatten into a rotating disk where the falling potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. For the next million years, as the disk continues to spin faster, it begins to project a small amount of matter from its axis of rotation as its magnetic field begins to strengthen. Eventually, the density and temperature grows large enough where it becomes hot and dense enough to start combining hydrogen nuclei into helium in a process called nuclear fusion. It's at this point the core ignites andâ€¦<br /><br />

A star is born. <br /><br />

<p class="site__description">
The clumps of dust that have been collecting due to the violent spinning, start to form the planets of this new solar system. The ignition of nuclear fusion pushes the gas and dust away as it creates a void in the Nebula as it consumes all of the surrounding matter. The star gets larger and larger, increasing the void, destroying the disk, and stopping the growth of the planets. This entire process from collapse to star takes a star about the size of our Sun 50 million years. Then, it has a varying lifetime that can last billions of years. Our Sun, for example, has a life span of about 10 billion years. The process of nuclear fusion creates enough energy so that the star does not collapse under its own weight. After its billions of years, it's time for the star to hang up its coat.<br /><br />

The bigger the star the harder they fall, or rather, the quicker they implode. After a star burns through all of its hydrogen, nuclear reactions cease to occur which causes the core of the star to begin to collapse into itself as it becomes much hotter. Since hydrogen is still available in the shell, fusion continues as the shell pushes outward causing expansion and cooling which leads to the classing red giant. A large enough star my continue to perform fusion with elements such as helium, but this is only temporary. Eventually, the star will completely collapse where the size of its core decides its fate. <br /><br />

Average Stars (like our Sun), will collapse into White Dwarfs. About the size of our earth, it has the mass of the sun condensed. Interestingly, we must turn to quantum mechanics to explain why the star does not collapse further. Fast moving electrons keep the dwarf from collapsing further. This is the fate of all stars with a mass up to 1.4x the mass of our Sun. Excitingly, if a white dwarf forms in a binary or multiple start system, it's demise may come in the form of a Nova where it sucks the hydrogen of a nearby star and, in a burst of nuclear fusion, expels all of its remaining surface material.<br /><br />

Stars that are as big as 8 solar masses as destined to die the heroically awesome death of a Supernova which will leave behind either a Neutron Star or a Black Hole. Unlike a regular Nova, a Supernova's core collapses and then explodes. Complex nuclear reactions lead to the production of iron and, when the core can no longer support its own mass, the core shrinks from around 5000miles to a couple dozen in a couple of seconds with a temperature spike of over 100 billion degrees. For a period of time (from days to weeks), a supernova may outshine an entire galaxy and every naturally occurring element is produced along with a multitude of subatomic particles. When a star has a core between 1.4 to 3 solar masses, the collapse continues until elections and protons combine to form neutrons. They have immensely powerful magnetic fields, that if oriented so it points to earth, it creates a pulse of radiation called a pulsar. From the graveyard of dead stars, new stars arise and so continues the circle of life.<br /><br />

"But wait, you forgot about black holes?" I hear you say. On the contrary, I find them so interesting, I will dedicate an entire article talking about its unique properties and what kinds of stars have the capability to collapse into literal nothingness.<br /><br /><br />
